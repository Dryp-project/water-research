>"Decentralisation has also been welcomed for its potential to improve issues such as efficiency, equity, accessibility, responsiveness, and quality of services delivered...[however] There is nothing inherent in decentralisation which would ensure that it will be successful."  

>"...It is a major challenge to involve constructively and effectively a broad and diverse group of formal and informal organisations, many of whom may have only limited, or even no interest, in discussing specific issues irrespective of their overall impacts in improving some of the indicators of their quality of life. In fact, although stakeholders participation is frequently advocated, substantive stakeholder representation still has not been achieved, in the sense that there is no decision-making power in the hands of the minorities, ranging from local governments to the poor populations."  

>"...Some of the main reasons for promoting decentralisation processes can be traced to the lack of funds at the central level, dissatisfaction with the services provided by the central governments, and unnecessary bureaucracy which results in longer decision-making times. Furthermore, decentralisation is expected to benefit the societies as a result of public participation, due to the opportunities they have to express their views, preferences and concerns, at least in theory."

2. ["Overview: Beyond Scarcity Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis.” Human Development Report 2006](https://github.com/Dryp-project/water-research/blob/master/2006%20UNDP%20Report_Beyond%20scarcity%2C%20Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis%20.pdf)

> **This Report rejects th[at water scarcity [is] a purely physical infrastructure problem]...It argues that the roots of the crisis in water can be traced to poverty, inequality and unequal power relationships, as well as flawed water management policies that exacerbate scarcity”**  

>_"..the ill health associated with deficits in water and sanitation undermines productivity and economic growth, reinforcing the deep inequalities that characterize current patterns of globalization and trapping vulnerable households in cycles of poverty”_  

>_"...The perverse principle that applies across much of the developing world is that the poorest people not only get access to less water, and to less clean water, but they also pay some of the world’s highest prices.”_  

>"Underlying each of these problems is the fact that the people suffering the most from the water and sanitation crisis—poor people in general and poor women in particular—often lack the political voice needed to assert their claims to water."  

>“ What has been lacking is a concerted drive to extend access to water and sanitation for all through well designed and properly financed national plans, backed by a global plan of action to galvanize political will and mobilize resources.”  

>**"Ultimately, human development is about the realization of potential. It is about what people can do and what they can become—their capabilities—and about the freedom they have to exercise real choices in their lives. Water pervades all aspects of human development. When people are denied access to clean water at home or when they lack access to water as a productive resource their choices and freedoms are constrained by ill health, poverty and vulnerability. Water gives life to everything, including human development and human freedom"**

3. [“Water a Shared Responsibility.” The United Nations World Water Development Report, Mar. 2006.](https://www.notion.so/dryp/2006-Water-as-a-Shared-Responsibility-UNESCO-53d15b462ed04a04a0501812c1635caa#49143bb5fa224d5ca3f6db7ea47e723f)

>“The challenges for government agencies to link to NGOs and the private sector for resolving water issues further complicate management and decision-making. The task of managing water becomes even more complex when rivers flow from one country to another. The building of cooperative upstream-downstream relationships is becoming increasingly important with close to half of the world's people living in river basins or above aquifers that cross international borders.”  

>“There is a enough water for everyone. The problem we face today is largely one of governance: equitably sharing this water while ensuring the sustainability of natural ecosystems.”

>“New water-sharing models should not imply that only optimal solutions are acceptable. Reasonable approximations would be part of necessary trade-offs, balancing the 'ideal', or desired, future and the 'real', or pragmatic and practical, solution"  

>"Water increasingly appears to be the catalyst for cooperation and, thus, not only divides, but also unites peoples and societies."

>**“Greater transparency, accountability and stakeholder involvement is needed. One of the biggest roadblocks to achieving the MDGs is lack of investment by external donors.”  **


_**Concluding RECOMMENDATIONs:**_

- To appreciate the context within which water issues must be approached.

- To recognize that the various issues of water are interrelated - and with growing demand and, in general, decreasing supply, competition between uses and users is increasing, requiring greater wisdom in allocation of the resource.

- To appreciate the variety of circumstance - solutions have to be tailored to situation.

- To understand that water moves within natural limits - but that these do not usually correspond to the administrative units within which societies organize themselves.

- *To improve basic data through research. Greater knowledge and understanding* are prerequisites for better management of all the systems involved

- To focus on governance.

- To anticipate and adapt to changing circumstance.

- To all assume responsibility for action: There is a need for responsible action and involvement at all levels of society. Individuals at community level should be encouraged and given the means to take responsibility for their own problems. Likewise, at local and national levels, governments must take their share of responsibility. At international levels, responsibility must be taken to set goals and targets towards which the world should strive, and to assess the global situations with a view to sharing knowledge.

>**"This study assessed long-term groundwater depletion in 40 separate aquifer systems or subareas, and one land use category. The cumulative volume of groundwater depletion in the United States during the 20th century is large—totaling about 800 cubic kilometers (km3) and increasing by an additional 25 percent during 2001–2008 (to a total volume of approximately 1,000 km3)...This large volume of depletion represents a serious problem in the United States because much of this storage loss cannot be easily or quickly recovered and affects the sustainability of some critical water supplies and base flow to streams, among other effects."**

>"In addition to widely recognized adverse environmental effects of groundwater depletion, the depletion also impacts communities dependent on groundwater resources in that the continuation of depletion at observed rates makes the water supply unsustainable in the long term. However, depletion itself must certainly be unsustainable and the observed rates of depletion must eventually decrease as economic and physical constraints lead to reduced levels of extraction. Yet the data in table 2 and figure 57 demonstrate that the rates of depletion for some of the major aquifer system and land use categories dur-ing 2001–2008 are the highest since 1900, and in fact account for 25 percent of the total depletion during the 108-year period. Nevertheless, the rate of depletion is leveling off or becoming self-limiting in a number of areas, most notably the western alluvial basins (since 1980) and to a lesser degree the Central Valley (since the early 1990s)."  

>"Konikow (2011) also notes that oceans represent the ultimate sink for essentially all depleted groundwater. The surface area of the oceans is approximately 3.61×108 km2 (Duxbury and others, 2000). If the estimated volumes of depletion were spread across the surface of the oceans, it would account for _**approximately 2.2 mm of sea-level rise from 1900 through 2000 and 2.8 mm of sea-level rise from 1900 through 2008."**_

>"Early in the twentieth century, technological advances in dam construction and in hydroelectric power production and transmission combined with federal policies encouraging settlement of the West by subsidizing irrigation set the stage for a prolonged period of development and rapidly growing use of western waters. This growth continued unabated for seven decades until most of the rivers had been tamed and were being used intensively for irrigation, municipalities, industry, and hydropower production. Although flooding was reduced, flood damage increased as a result of intensive development of the flood plains. These developments and a willingness to ignore their impacts on instream flows and the values they provide supported an illusion that water was not scarce."

>"Water is universally underpriced, and engineering solutions are promoted to water resource problems that stem largely from poor management and misallocation of the resource. This paper examines the dIfficulties of and alternative approaches to balancing water demands with supplies under conditions of scarcity"

>Globally, water resources are abundant and completely renewable. Regionally, natural supplies are limited, highly variable, and uncertain. Average annual precipitation varies from virtually nothing in the driest deserts to as much as 10 meters in some areas... While groundwater resources are less susceptible, they are not immune to variations attributable to the hydrologic cycle and climate..."

> Rising water costs are inevitable for three reasons (Frederick, -199la).    
>- First, as a river basin is developed, the best sites for storing water and generating hydropower are developed first.  
>- Second There are also diminishing returns in the quantity of water controlled 'or the safe yield produced by successive increases in reservoir capacity.  
>- Third, the opportunity costs of storing and diverting water increase as the number of free flowing streams declines and as the value society attaches to instream water uses rises.

[Rosegrant, Mark W, et al. “Global Water Outlook to 2025: Averting an Impending Crisis.” International Food Policy Research Institute: A 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment Initiative, Sept. 2002](https://github.com/Dryp-project/water-research/blob/master/2002_Global%20Water%20Outlook%20to%202025-averting%20an%20impending%20crisis.pdf)

>“...Hardest hit will be the world’s poorest people. The results from the model used in this report also show the consequences of changing the course of water policy. Further inattention to water-related investments and policies will produce a severe water crisis, which will lead in turn to a food crisis. A commitment to sustainable use of water, through appropriate policies and investments, however, will lead to a more water- and food-secure world. Water may be a scarce resource, but humans have developed many ways of using it more efficiently — that is, getting more from each unit of water. But water-saving policies, practices, and technologies are of no help if they are not used. Inappropriate incentives and institutions often hinder effective use of water.” 

>“With slow growth in irrigation from surface water, farmers will expand pumping from groundwater, which is subject to low prices and little regulation. Regions that currently pump groundwater faster than aquifers can recharge, such as the western United States, northern China, northern and western India, Egypt, and West Asia and North Africa, will continue to do so. The cost of supplying water to domestic and industrial users will rise dramatically”

>“...political opposition from those concerned about the impact of higher water prices on farmers’ income and from entrenched interests that benefit from existing systems of allocating water..."
        
>"Better delivery and more efficient home water use will lead to some increase in the proportion of households connected to piped water. Many households, however, will remain unconnected."
       
>“As in the business as usual scenario, the rapid increase in urban populations will quickly raise demand for domestic water. But governments will lack the funds to extend piped water and sewage disposal to newcomers. *Governments will respond by privatizing urban water and sanitation services in a rushed and poorly planned fashion. The new private water and sanitation firms will be undercapitalized and able to do little to connect additional populations to piped water. An increasing number and percentage of the urban population must rely on high-priced water from vendors or spend many hours fetching often-dirty water from standpipes and wells.”*
     
>“...Water prices for connected households will double, with targeted subsidies for low-income households. Revenues from price increases will be invested to reduce water losses in existing systems and to extend piped water to previously unconnected households.”

>“Expanding water supplies can help alleviate water scarcity, but the results show that the most promising avenue is likely to be water management reforms, incentive policies, and investments in infrastructure and technology to enhance efficiency in existing uses.”

>**“Raising water prices seems to make sense for several reasons. Higher water prices not only encourage all users to use water more efficiently, but also could generate funds to maintain existing water infrastructure and to build new infrastructure.** **_Yet because of perceived political risks and concern that higher prices would hurt poor farmers and consumers, there have been few attempts to implement higher water prices. In fact, in most instances the poor suffer from current subsidized water prices because water subsidies in most countries go disproportionately to the better off: urban water users connected to the public system and irrigated farmers._**

>This report comes at a critical moment, when freshwater resources face rising pressure to provide for the social, economic and
environmental needs of a growing world population. 2015 is also a year of high expectations and hopes, as the deadline for
the Millennium Development Goals, and when States will define a new global sustainable development agenda to follow.
