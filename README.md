>"Decentralisation has also been welcomed for its potential to improve issues such as efficiency, equity, accessibility, responsiveness, and quality of services delivered...[however] There is nothing inherent in decentralisation which would ensure that it will be successful."  

>"...It is a major challenge to involve constructively and effectively a broad and diverse group of formal and informal organisations, many of whom may have only limited, or even no interest, in discussing specific issues irrespective of their overall impacts in improving some of the indicators of their quality of life. In fact, although stakeholders participation is frequently advocated, substantive stakeholder representation still has not been achieved, in the sense that there is no decision-making power in the hands of the minorities, ranging from local governments to the poor populations."  

>"...Some of the main reasons for promoting decentralisation processes can be traced to the lack of funds at the central level, dissatisfaction with the services provided by the central governments, and unnecessary bureaucracy which results in longer decision-making times. Furthermore, decentralisation is expected to benefit the societies as a result of public participation, due to the opportunities they have to express their views, preferences and concerns, at least in theory."
