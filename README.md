1. [Tortajada, Cecilia. “Human Development Reports.” Human Development Data (1990-2015) | Human Development Reports, 2006, hdr.undp.org/en/content/water-governance-equity-decentralisation-answer.](https://github.com/Dryp-project/water-research/blob/master/2006_Water%20Governance%20with%20Equity-%20is%20Decentralization%20the%20answer%20UNHD.pdf)

>"Decentralisation has also been welcomed for its potential to improve issues such as efficiency, equity, accessibility, responsiveness, and quality of services delivered...[however] There is nothing inherent in decentralisation which would ensure that it will be successful."  

>"...It is a major challenge to involve constructively and effectively a broad and diverse group of formal and informal organisations, many of whom may have only limited, or even no interest, in discussing specific issues irrespective of their overall impacts in improving some of the indicators of their quality of life. In fact, although stakeholders participation is frequently advocated, substantive stakeholder representation still has not been achieved, in the sense that there is no decision-making power in the hands of the minorities, ranging from local governments to the poor populations."  

>"...Some of the main reasons for promoting decentralisation processes can be traced to the lack of funds at the central level, dissatisfaction with the services provided by the central governments, and unnecessary bureaucracy which results in longer decision-making times. Furthermore, decentralisation is expected to benefit the societies as a result of public participation, due to the opportunities they have to express their views, preferences and concerns, at least in theory."

2. ["Overview: Beyond Scarcity Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis.” Human Development Report 2006](https://github.com/Dryp-project/water-research/blob/master/2006%20UNDP%20Report_Beyond%20scarcity%2C%20Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis%20.pdf)

> **This Report rejects th[at water scarcity [is] a purely physical infrastructure problem]...It argues that the roots of the crisis in water can be traced to poverty, inequality and unequal power relationships, as well as flawed water management policies that exacerbate scarcity”**  

>_"..the ill health associated with deficits in water and sanitation undermines productivity and economic growth, reinforcing the deep inequalities that characterize current patterns of globalization and trapping vulnerable households in cycles of poverty”_  

>_"...The perverse principle that applies across much of the developing world is that the poorest people not only get access to less water, and to less clean water, but they also pay some of the world’s highest prices.”_  

>"Underlying each of these problems is the fact that the people suffering the most from the water and sanitation crisis—poor people in general and poor women in particular—often lack the political voice needed to assert their claims to water."  

>“ What has been lacking is a concerted drive to extend access to water and sanitation for all through well designed and properly financed national plans, backed by a global plan of action to galvanize political will and mobilize resources.”  

>**"Ultimately, human development is about the realization of potential. It is about what people can do and what they can become—their capabilities—and about the freedom they have to exercise real choices in their lives. Water pervades all aspects of human development. When people are denied access to clean water at home or when they lack access to water as a productive resource their choices and freedoms are constrained by ill health, poverty and vulnerability. Water gives life to everything, including human development and human freedom"**

3. [“Water a Shared Responsibility.” The United Nations World Water Development Report, Mar. 2006.](link)

>“The challenges for government agencies to link to NGOs and the private sector for resolving water issues further complicate management and decision-making. The task of managing water becomes even more complex when rivers flow from one country to another. The building of cooperative upstream-downstream relationships is becoming increasingly important with close to half of the world's people living in river basins or above aquifers that cross international borders.”  

>“There is a enough water for everyone. The problem we face today is largely one of governance: equitably sharing this water while ensuring the sustainability of natural ecosystems.”

>“New water-sharing models should not imply that only optimal solutions are acceptable. Reasonable approximations would be part of necessary trade-offs, balancing the 'ideal', or desired, future and the 'real', or pragmatic and practical, solution"  

>"Water increasingly appears to be the catalyst for cooperation and, thus, not only divides, but also unites peoples and societies."

>**“Greater transparency, accountability and stakeholder involvement is needed. One of the biggest roadblocks to achieving the MDGs is lack of investment by external donors.”  **


_**Concluding RECOMMENDATIONs:**_
-To appreciate the context within which water issues must be approached.

- To recognize that the various issues of water are interrelated - and with growing demand and, in general, decreasing supply, competition between uses and users is increasing, requiring greater wisdom in allocation of the resource.

- To appreciate the variety of circumstance - solutions have to be tailored to situation.

- To understand that water moves within natural limits - but that these do not usually correspond to the administrative units within which societies organize themselves.

- *To improve basic data through research. Greater knowledge and understanding* are prerequisites for better management of all the systems involved

- To focus on governance.

- To anticipate and adapt to changing circumstance.

- To all assume responsibility for action: There is a need for responsible action and involvement at all levels of society. Individuals at community level should be encouraged and given the means to take responsibility for their own problems. Likewise, at local and national levels, governments must take their share of responsibility. At international levels, responsibility must be taken to set goals and targets towards which the world should strive, and to assess the global situations with a view to sharing knowledge.
